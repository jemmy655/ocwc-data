About
=====

This is experimental Open Data API to Courses that are currently tracked by OpenCourseWare Consortium.

We are currently setting first version of API endpoints as we transition to this system. Please note that API endpoints and/or return values might change at any time. We plan to finalize first version by the end of 2013.

This API currently directly powers <http://www.ocwconsortium.org> and is accessible at <http://data.ocwconsortium.org>
